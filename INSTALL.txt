Madagascar Installation
=======================

Prerequisites
=============

   1. C compiler. ANSI-compliant compiler such as GCC should work. GCC
   usually comes pre-installed on Linux machines.

   2. Python interpreter. Python is an interpretable programming
   language. It is used in Madagascar installation scripts and project
   management scripts. Python comes pre-installed on some platforms.

Environmental variables
=======================

   1.  Set the RSFROOT environmental variable to the directory where
you want RSF installed.

   2. Set the PYTHONPATH environmental variable to include
$RSFROOT/lib.

   3. Add $RSFROOT/bin to your PATH environmental variable.

   4. Set DATAPATH to the directory for temporary data files.

Once you have verified your enviornment variables, you will want to alter
your shell-specific user configuration file.

If you do not know which shell you are using, type the following at the
command line:

	printenv SHELL

If you do not know how to find and/or edit your configuration file, you should
learn this. In brief, 

	ls -a

will show you hidden files. Most likely the file you are looking for is called

	.cshrc

or

	.bash_profile

or something like that. In most cases appending the following text will work:

Example configuration for csh and tcsh:
=======================================

setenv RSFROOT /usr/local/rsf
if ($?PYTHONPATH) then
   setenv PYTHONPATH ${PYTHONPATH}:$RSFROOT/lib
else
   setenv PYTHONPATH $RSFROOT/lib
endif
set path = ($path $RSFROOT/bin)
setenv DATAPATH /var/tmp/

Example configuration for bash:
===============================

export RSFROOT=/usr/local/rsf
if [ -n "$PYTHONPATH" ]; then
   export PYTHONPATH=${PYTHONPATH}:$RSFROOT/lib
else
   export PYTHONPATH=$RSFROOT/lib
fi
export PATH=$PATH:$RSFROOT/bin
export DATAPATH=/var/tmp/

Notice the slash at the end of the DATAPATH variable.

Software construction
=====================

   1. Configuration.

      Change to the top RSF source directory and run

      ./configure

      You can examine the config.py file that this command
generates. Additional options are available. You can obtain a full
list of customizable variables by running "scons -h". For example, to
install C++ and Fortran-90 API bindings in addition to the basic
package, run

      ./configure API=c++,fortran-90

   2. Building and installing the package.

      Run "make install" or the following two commands in succession:

      make 
      make install

      If you need "root" privileges for installing under $RSFROOT, you
may need to run

      make
      su
      make install

      or

      make
      sudo make install

   3. Cleaning.

      To clean all intermediate files generated by SCons, run

      make clean

      To clean all intermediate files and all installed files, run

      make distclean

Testing Your Installation
=========================

Here are a few simple tests and and a brief introduction to Madagascar:

Typing any Madagascar command in a terminal window without parameters should
generate a brief documentation on that command. Try one of the following:

	sfin
	sfattr
	sfspike
	sfbandpass
	sfwiggle

If you get an error like "Command not found", you may not have your
PATH environment variable set correctly, or you may need to
issue the rehash command.

Now try making a simple Madagascar data file:

	sfspike n1=1000 k1=300 > spike.rsf

This command generates a one dimensional list of 1000 numbers, all zero except
for a spike equal to one at position 300. If this generates an error like

	Cannot write to data file /path/spike.rsf@: Bad file descriptor

you may need to create the directory pointed to by your DATAPATH
environment variable.

The file spike.rsf is a text header.  The actual data are stored in
the binary file pointed to by the in parameter in the header.  You
can look at the header file directly with more, or better, examine
the file properties with

	sfin spike.rsf

You can learn more about the contents of spike.rsf with

	sfattr < spike.rsf


The following command applies a bandpass filter to spike.rsf and puts
the result in filter.rsf:

	sfbandpass fhi=2 phase=1 < spike.rsf > filter.rsf

The following command makes a graphics file from filter.rsf:

	sfwiggle clip=0.02 title="Welcome to Madagascar" < filter.rsf > filter.vpl

If you have an X11 display program running, and your DISPLAY
environment variable is set correctly, you can display the graphics file with:

	xtpen < filter.vpl

You can pipe Madagascar commands together and do the whole thing at once like
this:

	sfspike n1=1000 k1=300 | sfbandpass fhi=2 phase=1 | \
	sfwiggle clip=0.02 title="Welcome to Madagascar" | xtpen

If you have SCons installed, you can use it to automate Madagascar processing.
Here is a simple SConstruct file to make filter.rsf and filter.vpl :

####################################
#
# Setting up
#
from rsfproj import *

#
# Make filter.rsf
#
Flow('filter',None,
     'spike n1=1000 k1=300 | bandpass fhi=2 phase=1')

#
# Make filter.vpl
#
Result('filter',
       'wiggle clip=0.02 title="Welcome to Madagascar"')

End()
####################################

Put the file in an empty directory, give it the name SConstruct,
cd to that directory, and issue the command:

	scons

The graphics file is now stored in the Fig subdirectory.  You can
view it manually with:

	xtpen Fig/filter.vpl

... or you can use:

	scons view

When an SConstruct file makes more than one graphics file, the  

	scons view 

command will display all of them in sequence. 

Now edit the SConstruct file: change the title string on the
Result line to "Hello World!", save the file, and rerun the scons
command. 

You will see that scons has figured out that the file
filter.rsf does not need to be rebuilt because nothing that affects
it has changed. Only the file filter.vpl is rebuilt.
