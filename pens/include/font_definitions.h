/*
 * NUM_FONTS is the total number of fonts.
 * Font 0 should be the good old pen font.
 * The Marker routine assumes that fonts 15 and 16
 * are math and misc fonts.
 * Other than that, I suppose you can reorder them as you like
 * but probably it's a good idea to leave the first 17 fonts just
 * like I've got them here.
 *
 * Additional device-independent fonts can be added quite easily.
 * Fonts 100 and up are reserved for hardware device-dependent fonts,
 * however!
 *
 * The ERRFONT (normally font 0; it is defined in gentext.c) MUST be
 * loaded at compile time. (If your error font itself has an error,
 * woe to you!)
