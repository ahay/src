  Export Restriction Disclaimer:
  We believe that CWP/SU: Seismic Un*x is a low technology product that does
  not appear on the Department of Commerce CCL list of restricted exports.
  Accordingly, we believe that our product meets the qualifications of
  an ECCN (export control classification number) of EAR99 and we believe
  it fits the qualifications of NRR (no restrictions required), and
  is thus not subject to export restrictions of any variety.

void mksinc (float d     /* fractional distance to interpolation point; 0.0<=d<=1.0 */,

/*< Compute least-squares optimal sinc interpolation coefficients.

The coefficients are a least-squares-best approximation to the ideal
sinc function for frequencies from zero up to a computed maximum
frequency.  For a given interpolator length, lsinc, mksinc computes
the maximum frequency, fmax (expressed as a fraction of the nyquist
frequency), using the following empirically derived relation (from
a Western Geophysical Technical Memorandum by Ken Larner):

	fmax = min(0.066+0.265*log(lsinc),1.0)

Note that fmax increases as lsinc increases, up to a maximum of 1.0.
Use the coefficients to interpolate a uniformly-sampled function y(i) 
as follows:

            lsinc-1
    y(i+d) =  sum  sinc[j]*y(i+j+1-lsinc/2)
              j=0

Interpolation error is greatest for d=0.5, but for frequencies less
than fmax, the error should be less than 1.0 percent. >*/
