<p>
The Rice Vector Library ("RVL") provides
  <ul>
    <li>a system of types for portable expression of coordinate- and representation-free
    ("matrix free") algorithms in optimization and linear algebra, and
    </li>
    <li>uniform mechanisms to build concrete instances of these types via computations of
    arbitrary complexity.
    </li>
  </ul>

  RVL enables high-quality implementations of numerical algorithms to
be shared across the wide variety of data structures and computing
platforms that occur in solving large-scale simulation-driven
optimization problems arising in science and engineering. Algorithms
such as Krylov subspace methods (CG, LSQR, BiCGStab,...), quasi-Newton
methods (L-BFGS, Trust Region Truncated Newton,...), matrix-free and
active set SQP, IRLS, ISTC, FISTA, and so on can be coded once and
used <i>without alteration</i> to solve a wide variety of control, design, and inverse
problems, in Un*x computing environments ranging from laptops to
high-performance massively parallel clusters.
<p>
  This library is written entirely in ISO C++, and uses its abstraction facilities
  to achieve portability across applications and
  environments. While other means exist to accomplish these ends, C++ is
  universally available in HPC systems, provides object-oriented and
  generic programming models, and offers easy access to
  many existing high performance numerical and infrastructure libraries written in C and
  Fortran.
<p>
<b>Obtaining RVL:</b>
<p>
See the <a href="http://www.trip.caam.rice.edu/software/software.html">TRIP software page</a> for current download instructions and release notes.

  <p>
  <b>Subpackage directory:</b>

  <ul> <li> <a href="../../rvl/doc/html/index.html">RVL</a> -
Fundamental interfaces defining <i>calculus in Hilbert space</i>:
vector spaces, vectors, linear and nonlinear scalar- and vector-valued
functions, and closely related concepts such as product (block data,
operator) decompositions and abstract quality control tests for
derivatives, adjoints, etc. Also <i>data management</i> types (data
containers, function objects) - uniform abstract interfaces to
concrete data structures and implementations.  </li> <li> <a
 href="../../local/doc/html/index.html">LocalRVL</a> - A simple
realization of the data management hierarchy for containers that
expose a pointer to a contiguous block of memory (C or Fortran
arrays). Useful both in itself and as building block for more complex
in-core, out-of-core, and distributed data management
schemes. Includes various utilities.  </li> <li> <a
 href="../../mpirvl/doc/html/index.html">MPIRVL</a> - MPI wrappers for
the local RVL classes - makes them available in various ways (from
serial on rank 0 to various forms of distribution) in distributed
applications.  </li> <li> <a
 href="../../alg/doc/html/index.html">Algorithm</a> - An algorithm is
a von Neumann machine, that is, you start it and it runs until it
stops. This subpackage contains simple abstractions for Algorithms and
Terminators (objects equipped to give an answer, "yes" or "no" on
various grounds, to the question, "should this algorithm
continue?"). Various standard combinations build loops, lists,
decision trees etc. and give an elegant mechanism for expressing
virtually any iterative algorithm.  </li> <li> <a
 href="../../umin/doc/html/index.html">Umin</a> - Unconstrained
minimization and iterative linear algebra algorithms, realized as
RVL::Algorithms. Quasi-Newton, trust region, Krylov subspace methods
for optimization, linear systems, and eigenvalue problems.  </li> <li>
<a href="../../seq/doc/html/index.html">Sequence</a> - Example,
discussed in the <a
 href="http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?doid=1499096.1499097">design
paper</a>, showing how infinite dimensional vector spaces can actually
be implemented in RVL, implying that dimension cannot be a general
attribute of an RVL vector space. Defines space of finite sequences, a
linear operator on them (polynomial multiplication), and approximates
the solution of a least squares problem.  <li> <a
 href="../../tsopt/doc/html/index.html">Time stepping for
optimization</a> - Time stepping methods encapsulated as RVL::Operator
interfaces, in terms of natural component interfaces. Groups forward,
linearized, and adjoint iterations together as coherent
object. Several schemes for random access to simulation history to
support adjoint state method, including implementations of of
Griewank's optimal checkpointing algorithm for both fixed and adaptive
time steps.  </li> <li> <a
 href="../../tests/doc/html/index.html">Tests</a> - a small set of
unit tests to verify correct installation of RVL and LocalRVL.  </li>
</ul>
<p>

<b>Installation</b><p>
RVL is currently configured to install under the <a href=./build.html>TRIP build
system</a>, using Gnu Make. The master makefile MakeBuild, in the top
level directory, defines these targets:
<ul>
<li>default: makes every target in every package, except docs and
  regression output </li>
  <li>install: removes any vestiges of previous installations,
  rebuilds libraries and commands (in package main directories)</li>
  <li>lib: incremental make of all libraries</li>
  <li>bin: incremental make of all commands - for those that may
  depend on external libraries, always relinks</li>
  <li>clean: removes all intermediate files</li>
  <li>burn: removes all installation products, returns package to
  original state</li>
  
  <li>doc: builds all docs from source - requires that doxygen be
  installed and command-line accessible, and that the doxygen command
  be aliased to the environment variable DOXYGEN</li>
  <li>regress: runs regression tests in all subpackages that have them
  defined, collects results in regress.rpt in the top level
  directory</li>
  </ul>
<p>
  To make target xxx from this list, enter
  <p>
  make -f MakeBuild xxx
  <p>
  See <a href=./build.html>the TRIP build system page</a> for
  information about setting compiler options, local builds in the
  subpackages, etc.
<p>
  <b>Unit Tests</b>

  <p> Several of the packages contain unit tests. The test directory
  contains unit tests that exercise RVL base classes using LocalRVL
  subclasses, hence tests both sets of classes. Unit tests are (a)
  self-contained except for the class definitions they are designed to
  test, (b) depend only weakly on environment, (c) produce only ascii
  output which can be compared to stored results using diff. Since
  some of the results are floating point, some environment dependence
  cannot be ruled out. If "differs from reference" results are
  reported, the installer should examine the individual regression
  output to assess correctness. The test output is typically verbose
  enough that browsing it should enable the user to discern whether
  minor floating-point differences are responsible for any deviation
  from stored reference results, or whether some more serious
  misbehaviour is at issue.
<p>
  The top-level regress target runs all regression tests and collects
  the results in regress.rpt in the top-level directory.

RVL grew out of the Hilbert Class Library project, whose main authors
were Mark Gockenbach and William Symes. Earlier work by Jon Claerbout,
Dave Nichols, Lester Dye, and others provided important inspirations
for the design of HCL and later RVL. Shannon Scott, Tony Padula and
William Symes created the first usable version of RVL in 2004-5. The
package was subsequently refined and enhanced by Symes, Hala Dajani,
Marco Enriquez, and Dong Sun. The TOMS paper describes in detail the
relation between RVL and similar projects. Tony Padula invented the
Algorithm package and described it in his PhD thesis. Padula also
wrote the first version of the Umin package. Marco Enriquez and
William Symes developed the Time-stepping for optimization package.

<p> Development of RVL and related projects was made possible by
grants from from the National Science Foundation, the Department of
Energy, ExxonMobil Upstream Research Company, and by generous support
from the sponsors of The Rice Inversion Project.
