\chapter{Writing reproducible papers, books, and reports}

Chapter~\ref{chapter:scons} describes some of the SCons tools used by
Madagascar users to write papers, books, and reports with reproducible
examples. In this chapter, we will take a closer look at an example paper.

\section{Overview of \LaTeX and SEG\TeX}

\LaTeX is a document markup language developed originally by Leslie
Lamport in early 1980s \cite[]{latex} as an extension of Donuld
Knuth's \TeX system \cite[]{tex}. \LaTeX is widely used in different
fields of science and engineering.

\LaTeX files are text files that can be edited in regular text
editors. Similarly to HTML and Markdown, \LaTeX is a descriptive
language: one can learn it by example following other \LaTeX
documents. As of 2016, the Madagascar package contains more than 200
papers and book chapters written in \LaTeX. You can find the source of
this chapter in
\href{https://github.com/ahay/src/blob/master/book/m8r/latex/paper.tex}
     {\$RSFSRC/book/m8r/latex/paper.tex}
and attached in the appendix.

SEG\TeX is a collection of \LaTeX macros developed for geophysical
publications, such as \emph{Geophysics} articles, SEG (Society of
Exploration Geophysicists) Annual Meeting abstracts, etc. SEG\TeX is
an open-source project maintained by a group of volunteers. It
integrates well with Madagascar to support the practice of
\emph{reproducible research}, as formulated by Jon Claerbout: ...

\LaTeX processing scripts included with Madagascar can turn a single
document into multiple outputs: paper in a journal, chapter in a book,
an expanded abstract for a conference, etc. It can also produce
multiple output formats, namely PDF and HTML.

The \LaTeX-processing scripts in Madagascar follow a system developed
earlier at SEP (Stanford Exploration Project) for implementing Jon
Claerbout's vision of reproducible research \cite[]{sep}.
